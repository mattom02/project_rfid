This project is a fluid level sensor with an access control consisting of using RFID-RC522 module. Whole project is based on Arduino UNO R3 with Atmega328, it uses LCD display to show messages and 2 buttons to navigate through menu. It also has a diode to warn if the fluid level is too high. After launching the microcontroller, you have to add the first card which will be used to unlock the menu. Then you will see a message, that device is locked. In order to unlock it, you have to place the card at the card reader. If the card isn't added, you will see a message, that a wrong card has been placed. In the locked menu section you can also see warnings about fluid level under the "Locked" message. When the fluid level is too high the diode will start to blink. In order to turn off the blinking, not only the fluid level has to be lowered, but also you have to delete the error in the menu. If you try to remove the error when it hasn't occurred, you will see a message that there isn't any error. Also there are other 3 options in the menu like: check fluid level which displays current fluid level in percentage, add a new card (in this option you can't add a card that already exists and the maximum number of cards is 5, you can't add more) and lock the device.
